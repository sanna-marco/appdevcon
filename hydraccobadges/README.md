A Flutter module to display a draco lizard rewarding the user for drinking ... water.

## What to do with that

Export to either xcframework for iOS (see create_frameworks.sh) or aar for Android (see create_aar.sh).
If you want to exchange data you can use Pigeon. Just run `dart run pigeon --input pigeons/pigeon_hydration.dart` to create all necessary files.
